# ChargeX - EV-EVSE Interoperability Test Plan


## Overview

The Testing Task Force of the [ChargeX](https://inl.gov/chargex/) Consortium developed Version 1 and 2.0 of the EV-EVSE Interoperability Test Plan (EEITP). This task force included researchers from:

- Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)
- Idaho National Laboratory (INL)
- National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)

The objective of this test plan is to establish a standardized procedure for evaluating interoperability between Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSEs), using applicable standards and protocols such as ISO, SAE, OCPP, and others.

This repository includes the following documents and tools, designed to assist researchers in performing EV-EVSE interoperability testing:

- **ChargeX - ITP Navigator.exe**  
  A standalone application for navigating the EEITP content.

- **EEITP.pdf**  
  A complete test suite containing all interoperability test cases developed as of July 2025.

- **Interoperability Test Plan Version 2.xlsx**  
  The raw Excel version of the EEITP, as originally developed.

- **Template_Interoperability Test Table.docx**  
  A Word template that test conductors can use to create their own interoperability test tables.


## Latest Version Information

- **Version:** 2.0  
- **Release Date:** July 2025

## License

This test plan is an open-source, formal deliverable of the ChargeX Consortiumâ€™s efforts to promote standardized EV-EVSE interoperability testing. Designed as a living document, the EEITP will be updated periodically to reflect new field data and insights. Ongoing development and maintenance will be led by researchers at Argonne National Laboratory. 

Future revisions will be driven by international initiatives and working groups committed to advancing global EV-EVSE interoperability standards.
