# ChargeX ‚Äì EV-EVSE Interoperability Test Plan

## üß≠ Overview

The Testing Task Force of the [ChargeX](https://inl.gov/chargex/) Consortium developed Versions 1.0 and 2.0 of the EV-EVSE Interoperability Test Plan (EEITP). This task force includes researchers from:

- Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)  
- Idaho National Laboratory (INL)  
- National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)  

The objective of the EEITP is to establish a standardized procedure for evaluating interoperability between Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), using applicable industry standards and protocols such as ISO, SAE, OCPP, and others.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Steps

Versions 1.0 and 2.0 of the EEITP were developed through a collaborative effort involving laboratory researchers, industry stakeholders, and continuous input from EV and EVSE original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), testing professionals, and consultants.

The test procedures were piloted and refined during [CharIN](https://www.charin.global/) North America Testivals, where OEM feedback directly informed improvements in clarity, reproducibility, and relevance.

The initial version of the EEITP was developed in Excel and included key test definition fields such as:

- **Nr**, **Test Category**, **Test Type**, **Test Name**, **Purpose**, **Steps**, **Pass Criteria**,  **Observed Metrics**, **Intended MRECs**, **Other Possible MRECs**, **Test Conditions**,  **Applicable OSI Layer**, **Repeatability Requirement**, **Estimated Duration** , **Electrical Safety Level**, and **Test Case Notes**

To improve usability, a desktop GUI was later developed using HTML and Python to allow more accessible navigation through the test suite.

Designed as a **living document**, the EEITP will continue to evolve based on field data, test event feedback, and global interoperability initiatives. Ongoing updates and maintenance are led by **Argonne National Laboratory.**

Future revisions will be aligned with international working groups and standardization bodies committed to advancing global EV-EVSE interoperability.
